# Tanks-Unity-Game
A tutorial I used to learn how to create a 2 player shooter game, including simple game mechanics, integrating world and screen space UI, as well as game architecture and audio mixing.


Instructions
------------------

Player 1 : Spacebar to shoot; w,a,s,d controls to move
Player 2: Enter to shoot; Keys (up,down,left,right) to move

First player to 5 round wins is the game winner, friendly fire is on.
